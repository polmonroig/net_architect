This is visual-programming tool made to specifically to design neural networks using an interactive
UI, it is also able to export the designed models as a Pytorch or Tensorflow file.

## Repo structure ##
This repository is structured in 5 main folders

    <li><b>src/</b> Contains the main code of the application</li>
    <li><b>images/</b> Contains sample images and in-app images</li>
